# Responsive-Testimonial

In this mini project [Responsive Testimonials Section], there are three testimonials box or card on the webpage and inside each box, there is a quote, name, job, and stars rating of that person. This testimonial section is fully responsive for any devices like mobiles and tablets. On the PC, these boxes are shown in a horizontal line but on mobile devices, these boxes are shown vertically.
